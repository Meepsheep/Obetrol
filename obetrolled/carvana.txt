Hello,

Unfortunately we believe that earlier today you received an email from Carvana containing offensive language in the subject line, and we wanted to apologize; we do not tolerate that kind of language and would never communicate with our customers in that way. When investigating the source, we discovered that a bad actor unaffiliated with Carvana had created a handful of fake accounts using email addresses like yours.

We have identified and isolated the issue, and we are extremely sorry this happened and that you were affected. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at 1-800-333-4554 or executiveresolution@carvana.com.

Thank You,

Carvana
