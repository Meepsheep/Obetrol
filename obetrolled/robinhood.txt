Subject: Regarding Our Recent Email

Hello, 
 
Earlier this morning, multiple applications were started on the Robinhood platform using fake names and real email addresses—including your email address.
 
Our system sends automatic email reminders to applicants with unfinished applications. You may have seen this email earlier today and, if so, we're very sorry for your experience.
 
We want to let you know that our team has stopped this activity and is actively working to help prevent a similar situation from happening again. 
 
This is not in line with the experience we want anyone to have with Robinhood, especially as a first impression. We’re deeply sorry about this. 
 
As a corrective action, we will close the unfinished application attached to your email address so you should not receive any communications from us going forward about the application.
 
Please let our team know if you have any concerns or questions. We’re here to help.
