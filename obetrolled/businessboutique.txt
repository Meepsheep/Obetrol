Subject: We Owe You An Apology

Hello,

We want to extend our sincerest apologies for the message you may have received this morning. Earlier today, an email sign up form was populated on our website by a spam robot and was used to send an offensive email. This was not a breach of data, but a mass email from a spam bot. We are personally appalled by the language in the email, and we reject the derogatory terms that were used. We are truly sorry if you received this email.

We have received multiple reports that this technique has been used on other websites not associated with our company.

We care deeply about our Business Boutique tribe and have taken every measure to ensure this will not happen again. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at hello@businessboutique.com. Again, we are truly sorry and please know this is not a reflection of our beliefs.

Sincerely,

Christy Wright, Creator of Business Boutique
Jennifer Sievertsen, Chief Marketing Officer of Ramsey Solutions
